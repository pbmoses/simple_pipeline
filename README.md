# simple_pipeline
public POC of a simple Tekton pipeline. Pair this with the argocd vault injection to develop and end to end solution with secret injection. The end goal of this is to build multiple how to's to display a working end to end CI/CD solution which can help introduce many to the Pipeline/GitOps world. This is not intended for advanced CI/CD knowledge but some of the components may approach the advanced level(s) for some. Keep an open mind and utilize the overall problem solving process and you should be able to follow along easily.
